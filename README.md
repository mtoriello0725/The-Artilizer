# The-Artilizer

Do you ever wonder what attracts you the most to your favorite artists? Maybe its makes you dance, maybe the lyrics are inspiring, or maybe an artist triggers nostalgia to a significant time in your life. 

The Artilizer is not a recommender tool, but instead is a deep analysis of every song by your favorite artist to pinpoint:
- what musical traits an artist excels at
- how much variety exists in an artist's discography
- compares stats to artists other fans listen to

This program uses Spotify's Web API for all data, and is programmed in Python using NUMPY, PANDAS, and SPOTIPY packages.

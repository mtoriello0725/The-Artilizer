# The-Artilizer
Do you ever wonder what attracts you the most to your favorite artists? Maybe its makes you dance, maybe the lyrics resonate very well with you, or maybe an artist triggers nostalgia to a meaningful time in your life. The Artilizer is not a recommender tool, but instead is a deep analysis of every song by your favorite artist to pinpoint what musical traits they excel at, and how much variety exists in their discography.

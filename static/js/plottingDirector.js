function plotManager(artistName) {
	/* 
	This function will trigger all of the plotting functions and return
	outputs to the proper html tags. Will need to make calls for:

	- Mean values of each attribute (in a melt dataframe.)

	- all album names (possibly album images) to visualize attributes by album

	- attributes by album (album names above will be trigger for album charts)

	- top popular songs
